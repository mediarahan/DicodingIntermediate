In addition to the techniques shown in the prerequisite course's [submission](https://github.com/mediarahan/DicodingFundamental), this project is a showcase of my understanding of intermediate concepts in Android Development, specifically about:
- Making custom animations and UI, such as for validating input fields when entering register or login info
- Implementing Paging to ensure a seamless experience when user is scrolling by continuously fetching post data
- Manual dependency injection
- How to access the device's camera, gallery to obtain media such as photos and videos
- Uploading photos to server using Retrofit and Multipart
- How to use Google's Maps API to implement a location-based feature
